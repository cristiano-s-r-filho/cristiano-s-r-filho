# Hello, I'm Cristiano Santos R. Filho ðŸ‘‹

Computer Science student passionate about transforming data into actionable insights and optimizing systems for maximum efficiency and security. My current focus is on deepening my knowledge in information security, data integrity, and robust software development.

## About Me

With a solid foundation in programming (Python, C/C++) and practical experience in Linux/Unix system administration, I constantly seek challenges that allow me to apply and expand my skills. I am a methodical thinker, with strong logical reasoning and an unwavering dedication to precision and procedural rigor. I believe that attention to detail and the continuous pursuit of improvement are fundamental to building high-impact solutions.
